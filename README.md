# Zircuit Whitelister

## Abstract

## Problem

Zircuit - quarantine

AI - unreliable / unpredictable
I would be worried to lend in protocol where AI can block liquidations

Customizable Transaction Policies for Institutions - defeats purpose of crypto
    fictitious court process
    institutions misbehave
    congress members misbehave
Permissionless version of this would be OK

How about pre-deposits

- If human decides - back to square 1
- If proof decides - OK ...

## Opportunity

ZK Pre-computation
Prolog -> Horn Clauses -> Trace Proof -> On-EVM verification (needed, or just aggregation?)

## Proposed Solution

Pre-execute: all inputs are constants, all read-only.
ZK proof of pre-execute
